PixelPipes is an open-source project that will hopefully attract some collaborators. Its initial concept is rooted in requirements for my postdoc project that also funded most of initial work.
The development of this package was in part supported by Sloveninan research agency (ARRS) projects Z2-1866, J2-316 and J7-2596.
