VOT and segmented resource lists
================================

Visual Object Tracking (VOT) datasets are sequence datasets for visual tracking performance evaluation. Usually, these kind of datasets would
not be used for training, however, other similar datasets exist and the example can be adapted for them. In this example we will
introduce a segmented resource sequence, a data abstraction for storing many sequences of resources into a single list. We will also use
the official toolkit of the VOT challenge to retrieve data. Note that the toolkit is not required anymore once a pipeline is constructed (and serialized).
